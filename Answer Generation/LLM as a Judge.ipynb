This ensures that the chosen securities have a high credit quality and low default risk.\\n\\n**2. Similar Expected Payment Profile**: The portfolio of sovereign risk securities must have a similar expected payment profile to the liability being measured. To determine whether the payment profiles are similar, Captive Insurers should consider the following factors:\\n\\n* **Cash Flow Patterns**: The frequency and timing of cash inflows and outflows in the selected portfolio should be comparable to those of the liability being measured. For example, if the liability has a regular annual premium stream, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also have a similar regular payment schedule.\\n* **Cash Flow Volatility**: The volatility of cash flows in the selected portfolio should be comparable to that of the liability being measured. For instance, if the liability has significant upfront payments or unpredictable cash outflows, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also exhibit similar characteristics.\\n* **Payment Duration**: The duration of payments in the selected portfolio should align with the expected payment profile of the liability being measured. This means that if the liability has a long-term obligation, the chosen sovereign risk securities should have a similar long-term payment structure.\\n* **Repayment Terms**: The repayment terms of the selected portfolio should be comparable to those of the liability being measured. For example, if the liability has balloon payments or amortizing schedules, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also have similar repayment structures.\\n\\nTo ensure compliance with these requirements, Captive Insurers can consider the following best practices:\\n\\n* **Analysis of Credit Rating Agencies' Reports**: Review reports from Standard & Poor's (or equivalent) to verify that the selected sovereign risk securities meet the AAA-rating threshold.\\n* **Customized Stress Testing**: Conduct stress testing to assess how the selected portfolio would perform under various economic scenarios, including changes in interest rates, inflation, or credit spreads.\\n* **Review of Historical Data**: Examine historical payment data for both the liability being measured and the chosen sovereign risk securities to identify any similarities or differences in cash flow patterns.\\n\\nBy carefully evaluating these factors and considering best practices, Captive Insurers can select a suitable portfolio of sovereign risk securities that meets the requirements of Rule 6.10 or 6.11 and provides an accurate\"},\n",

This discerning approach is shown by the FSRAâ€™s power to only permit VAs that it deems â€˜acceptableâ€™, as determined by risk factors such as security and traceability, in order to prevent the build-up of risk from illiquid or immature assets.

       "   'Principle 2 â€“ High Standards for Authorisation. ADGM has become the destination of choice for many start-ups and investors in the VA sector as well as extant financial institutions looking to expand into this area. Since 2018 the FSRA has issued a number of Financial Services Permissions (FSPs) to trading venues (e.g. multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)) and market intermediaries, such as broker dealers, custodians and asset managers, and continues to provide the regulatory architecture for a vibrant, VA ecosystem.'],\n",
       "  'Answer': \"In the context of Principle 2 â€“ High Standards for Authorisation, the ADGM evaluates and defines 'acceptable' Virtual Assets (VAs) through a discerning approach that prioritizes risk management and upholds high standards. The evaluation process involves assessing various risk factors to ensure that only VAs with robust security and traceability measures are permitted. This assessment is critical in preventing the accumulation of risk from illiquid or immature assets.\\n\\nThe key risk factors considered in this assessment include:\\n\\n1. **Security**: The ADGM evaluates the security protocols and controls implemented by the VA to prevent unauthorized access, hacking, or other forms of cyber threats.\\n2. **Traceability**: The FSRA assesses the ability of VAs to provide a clear audit trail, enabling the identification of transactions and participants in the event of any issues.\\n\\nIn addition to these risk factors, the ADGM also considers the VA's underlying model of valuation. Specifically, it does not permit stablecoins based on an algorithmic model of valuation tied to the underlying fiat currency. This approach ensures that VAs are not subject to potential volatility or manipulation risks associated with algorithmic valuation models.\\n\\nThe FSRA's risk appetite for VA activities is such that it will only admit operators to its jurisdiction who can demonstrate a high level of transparency and adherence to best-in-class standards. This includes:\\n\\n1. **Transparent business practices**: The ADGM requires VAs to maintain transparent business practices, including clear disclosure of fees, risks, and other material information.\\n2. **Compliance with regulatory requirements**: VA operators must demonstrate compliance with all applicable regulations and laws in the ADGM jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe goal of these high standards is to instill market confidence, promote growth and investment, and maintain the best-in-class reputation of the ADGM ecosystem. By admitting only operators who meet these rigorous standards, the ADGM provides a secure and stable environment for VA activities, making it an attractive destination for start-ups, investors, and established financial institutions looking to expand into the VA sector.\\n\\nIn summary, the ADGM's evaluation and definition of 'acceptable' VAs are guided by a discerning approach that prioritizes risk management, security, traceability, transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements. By adopting this approach, the ADGM ensures a high level of confidence among market participants, fosters growth and investment in the VA sector, and maintains its position as a leading jurisdiction for Virtual Asset activities.\"},\n",

For example, a Reporting Entity may have a small Board to reflect the small and less complex nature of its business, as opposed to a larger and more complex business which requires a larger Board.

       "  'Answer': 'Here is a detailed answer that fully integrates all the obligations and best practices from the given passages:\\n\\n**ADGM\\'s Guidance on Best Practices for Documenting Corporate Governance Practices Related to ESG Issues**\\n\\nIn light of the \"comply or explain\" approach adopted by ADGM, we understand that companies may choose not to disclose certain ESG-related information. To provide guidance on documenting corporate governance practices related to such issues, we recommend the following best practices:\\n\\n1. **Clear Rationale**: When deciding not to submit ESG disclosures, it is essential to clearly articulate the reasons for this determination. This should be documented in a formal correspondence addressed to monitoring@adgm.com, as required by subsection 399B(5) of the CR.\\n2. **Explanation**: The company should provide a comprehensive explanation for its decision, highlighting any challenges or circumstances that led to this choice. This explanation should demonstrate an understanding of the \"comply or explain\" approach and the flexibility it offers.\\n3. **Governance Processes**: Companies are encouraged to document their governance processes related to ESG issues, even if they choose not to disclose certain information. This includes describing how they assess, manage, and monitor ESG risks and opportunities.\\n4. **Tailored Approach**: Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance, companies should tailor their practices to suit their specific circumstances. This may involve adapting the principles outlined in the standards or adopting alternative approaches that achieve effective outcomes.\\n5. **Transparency**: While not disclosing all ESG-related information, companies are still expected to provide transparency regarding their decision-making process and any relevant factors considered. This can be achieved by documenting the rationale behind their choice and providing context for stakeholders.\\n6. **Board Considerations**: As emphasized in the General passage, companies with smaller boards or less complex businesses may choose not to establish multiple committees. In such cases, the board as a whole should undertake these functions, and this decision should be documented accordingly.\\n7. **Continuous Improvement**: Companies that choose not to disclose ESG-related information should remain committed to continuous improvement in their governance practices. This involves regularly reviewing and assessing their processes to ensure they are aligned with the company\\'s goals and values.\\n\\nBy following these best practices, companies can effectively document their corporate governance practices related to ESG issues, even if they choose not to disclose certain information. This ensures transparency, accountability, and a commitment to continuous improvement, all of which are essential for fostering an ecosystem that supports good practice in disclosing applicable information on ESG factors.\\n\\n**'},\n",
