Additionally, we do not permit stablecoins based on the algorithmic model of valuation to the underlying fiat currency.\\n\\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nWhen considering the FATF Recommendations, in combination with the application of the AML Rules, the FSRA notes the following key principles that an Authorised Person conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets should consider:\\n\\na)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\\nFATF expects countries, regulators, financial institutions and other concerned parties to adopt a ‘Risk Based Approach’ (“RBA”). Authorised Persons are expected to understand the risks associated with their activities and allocate proper resources to mitigate those risks. A RBA can only be achieved if it is embedded into the compliance culture of the Authorised Person, which enables the Authorised Person to make decisions and allocate appropriate resources in the most efficient and effective way.\\n\\nb)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\\nAuthorised Persons should, on a periodic basis, carry out a proper risk based assessment of their processes and activities. In order to implement the RBA, Authorised Persons are expected to have processes in place to identify, assess, monitor, manage and mitigate ML risks. The general principle is that in circumstances where there are higher risks of ML, Authorised Persons are required to implement enhanced measures to manage and mitigate those risks.\\n\\nc)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\\nOne of the most challenging risks facing financial institutions is how the on-boarding of an Authorised Person may affect its relationship with foreign correspondent financial institutions, as well as the views of the regulator of those foreign correspondent financial institutions. In essence, a foreign correspondent financial institution relationship is built on the effectiveness of a financial institution’s ML compliance program and ongoing monitoring capabilities.\\n\\nd)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 1: Risk Based Approach\\nWith the use of cryptology and block chain technologies at a nascent stage within financial services, any financial institution banking an Authorised Person must not only satisfy itself, but also its foreign correspondent financial institution(s), that the Authorised Person is well regulated and has appropriate systems and controls in place to address ML, TF and sanctions risks.  These systems and controls should include robust processes to carry out CDD on Clients and beneficial owners, to monitor transactions for these risks, and the willingness and ability of the Authorised Person to provide complete transparency to its financial institution(s) and foreign correspondent financial institution(s) if and when required.\\n\\n\\ne)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\\nChapter 6 of the AML Rules requires Relevant Persons to take appropriate steps to identify and assess the ML risks to which their businesses are exposed, taking into consideration the nature, size and complexity of their activities. When identifying and assessing these risks, several factors should be considered, including an assessment of the use of new technologies.  Importantly, in the context of Virtual Assets, FATF Recommendation (15) states that:\\n\\n“Countries and financial institutions should identify and assess the money laundering or terrorist financing risks that may arise in relation to (a) the development of new products and new business practices, including new delivery mechanisms, and (b) the use of new or developing technologies for both new and pre-existing products. In the case of financial institutions, such a risk assessment should take place prior to the launch of the new products, business practices or the use of new or developing technologies. They should take appropriate measures to manage and mitigate those risks.”\\n\\nf)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\\nAnother aspect of assessing the business risk relevant to Authorised Persons is gaining familiarity with the characteristics and terminology  of the Virtual Asset industry. Additionally, Authorised Persons, and their management and staff, should be aware of the possible misuse of Virtual Assets in criminal activities, as well as the technical and complicated nature of Virtual Assets (and the platforms they operate on).\\n\\ng)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 2: Business Risk Assessment\\nWhen making its assessment, an Authorised Person must give consideration to all business risks. For example, while an issue may be identified in relation to cyber security (e.g., when dealing with hot wallets or using cloud computing to store data – being a ‘technology’ risk), the FSRA expects Authorised Persons to consider these risks from all perspectives to establish whether the risk triggers other issues for consideration (including ML/TF risks, technology governance and consumer protection).  An Authorised Person must then use the identified risks to develop and maintain its AML/CTF policies, procedures, systems and controls and take all reasonable steps to eliminate or manage such risks.\\n\\n\\nh)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nThe FSRA expects all Authorised Persons to have fully compliant Client on-boarding processes.  Virtual Assets have been criticised by regulatory bodies globally due to their (pseudo-)anonymity features, which makes tracking Client records and transactions more challenging for compliance officers and money laundering reporting officers.\\n\\ni)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nCustomer Risk Assessment and ‘Customer Due Diligence’ (“CDD”) policies and procedures are required to be implemented by all Authorised Persons. Authorised Persons should have a process to assess and rate all their Clients according to that Client’s risk profile (and taking into consideration the Authorised Persons’ RBA). This risk-based assessment is required to be undertaken for each Client prior to transacting any business on behalf of the Client. Authorised Persons must undertake CDD for each Client and comply in full with Chapter 8 of the AML Rules noting that the FSRA does not consider it appropriate for Authorised Persons to use simplified CDD when conducting a Regulated Activity in relation to Virtual Assets, largely due to issues surrounding the (pseudo-) anonymity of Clients and transactions associated with Virtual Assets.\\n\\nj)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nIn the case of non-face-to-face on-boarding and ongoing due diligence of Clients who are natural persons, the FSRA expects that an Authorised Person will develop appropriate policies to ensure that the Client’s identity is duly verified in accordance with all applicable Laws and Rules. This may include obtaining a “selfie” or by conducting a “liveness test”. Irrespective of the method employed, it should validate that the individual being on-boarded is present during the on-boarding process, matches the individual in the identity documentation, and that the ID presented is valid and authentic. It should also include obtaining and authenticating a valid form of the Client’s facial ID, which should be either the Client’s passport with all applicable details clear and, or the original version (front and back) of an official government issued document, such as a national ID or driver’s license. For the purposes of residents of the UAE, the primary form of documentation used should be the Client’s Emirates ID card.\\n\\nk)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nThe FSRA understands that Authorised Persons may need to use new technology to improve Client on-boarding processes for the purpose of assessing and managing ML and TF risks.  For example, in order for Authorised Persons to conduct non-face-to-face on-boarding they will need to implement facial recognition software to validate the “selfie” against the other uploaded documentation, or other suitable biometric technology.\\n\\nl)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nThe FSRA further understands that the proper use of such technologies (e.g., fingerprinting, retinal/eye scans, use of real-time video conference facilities to enable facial recognition) can assist with mitigation of the ML/TF risks associated with the use of Virtual Assets.  Technological features, such as secure digital signatures that allow the verification of a Client’s identity through a signed document, may also be acceptable to the FSRA. In all cases, an Authorised Person should ensure that the use of these technologies will not lead to a simplified process where the required Customer Risk Assessment and CDD requirements are not appropriately undertaken by an Authorised Person.\\n\\nm)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 3: Customer Risk Assessment and Customer Due Diligence\\nThe FSRA recommends that Authorised Persons obtain a signed self-certification from their Clients identifying the details of all passports issued and held in their name(s). Authorised Persons may also use this as an opportunity to capture all tax related details in order to meet their international tax reporting obligations. Self-certification should not prevent Authorised Persons from conducting proper CDD.\\n\\n\\nn)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nAuthorised Persons are required to implement an appropriate governance structure, especially in relation to Information Technology governance , and provide for the development and maintenance of all necessary systems and controls to ensure appropriate ML and TF compliance.\\n\\no)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nThe FSRA expects that Authorised Persons may seek to utilise (their own or third-party) technologies and solutions to meet their regulatory obligations (e.g., customer risk assessment, detection of fraud, and transaction identification, monitoring and reporting) and risk management requirements (e.g., margin limits, large exposure monitoring).\\n\\np)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and maintain effective transactional monitoring systems to determine the origin of a Virtual Asset and to monitor its destination, and to apply strong “know your transaction” measures which enable Authorised Persons to have complete granular data centric information about the transactions done by a Client.\\n\\nq)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to act responsibly and always be vigilant in ensuring that their activities are not subject to any misuse by participants transacting with Virtual Assets that may have been tainted in any way from an illegal activity.  The FSRA expects that an Authorised Person’s internal processes establish the types of ‘indicators’ or activities that could be used to identify when Accepted Virtual Assets may have been used in an illegal manner.  An Authorised Person should have a process for the management of when such ‘indicators’ (for example, certain Client or use of “mixer” and “tumbler” services) are triggered.\\n\\nr)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nWhile the FSRA cannot recommend particular vendors or providers, all technology solutions must be fit for purpose and Authorised Persons should consider using those with an established track record, and undertake their own due diligence/risk assessment to ensure competency and capability.  The FSRA recognises that many of the (technology) solutions appropriate for mitigating Virtual Asset risks are continuing to be developed within the Virtual Asset industry itself.\\n\\ns)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nThe FSRA expects Authorised Persons to develop, implement and adhere to a “Virtual Asset Compliance Policy”, tailored to meet specific Virtual Asset business compliance requirements, and reflecting a clear comprehension of the Authorised Person’s understanding of its compliance responsibilities.  The FSRA expects this policy to be well defined, comprehensive, robust and as specific to an individual Authorised Person’s activities as possible. The policy can be separate or part of other compliance policies/manuals.\\n\\nt)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nFollowing the development of the Virtual Asset Compliance Policy, Authorised Persons’ compliance officers are expected to establish a “Virtual Asset compliance monitoring program”, requiring internal reviews to be conducted in an efficient way, and on a periodic basis.\\n\\nu)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 4: Governance, Systems and Controls\\nAuthorised Persons must appoint a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (“MLRO”) who will be responsible for the implementation and oversight of the Authorised Person’s compliance with the AML Rules.

This requires an Authorised Person to implement specific arrangements to ensure that, at a minimum, the Authorised Person and the FSRA have access to all relevant information as necessary. An Authorised Person may use a distributed ledger to store its data, provided it is able to provide this data, in an easily accessible format, to the FSRA when required.\\n\\naa)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\\nThe FSRA views Virtual Asset activities that are linked to cash transactions as posing higher ML and TF risks, due to the source of funding being significantly more difficult to determine. Authorised Persons wishing to conduct cash transactions will be required to implement enhanced controls to mitigate the inherent risks of such transactions. Such controls may include, among other things, setting appropriate limits on cash deposits (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly limits), a prohibition on receiving cash directly, prohibitions on the receipt of cash other than from bank accounts, and prohibitions on receiving funds from third parties. In all cases, Authorised Persons will need to clearly demonstrate to the FSRA how their controls suitably mitigate the risks of cash transactions within their operations. Considering the wider consumer protection implications, the FSRA also considers it unlikely to be appropriate for Authorised Persons to accept deposits by way of credit card or credit facilities/credit lines.\\n\\nbb)\\tREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTHORISED PERSONS ENGAGED IN REGULATED ACTIVITIES IN RELATION TO VIRTUAL ASSETS\\nKey considerations for AML/CFT compliance\\nPrinciple 6: Record keeping\\nFSRA expects all Authorised Persons to exercise due care, to the utmost extent possible, in their day-to-day operations and when dealing with Clients or potential Clients.

Accordingly, a Person may make an Offer of Securities to the Public in the circumstances specified in this Rule without a Prospectus.\\n4.3.1 \\tFor the purposes of section 61(3)(a) of the FSMR the Regulator hereby prescribes the circumstances in which an Offer is an Exempt Offer:\\n(1)\\tan Offer made to or directed at only Professional Clients;\\n(2)\\tan Offer in or from the ADGM which is directed at no more than 50 Persons in any 12 month period, excluding Professional Clients who are not natural persons;\\n(3)\\tan Offer where the total consideration to be paid by a Person to acquire the Securities is at least $100,000, or an equivalent amount in another currency;\\n(4)\\tan Offer where the Securities are denominated in amounts of at least $100,000, or an equivalent amount in another currency;\\n(5)\\tan Offer where the total aggregate consideration for the Securities offered is less than $100,000, or an equivalent amount in another currency, calculated over a period of 12 months;\\n(6)\\tan Offer where Shares are issued in substitution for Shares of the same class as already issued, where the issue of the new Shares does not involve any increase in the issued Share capital;\\n(7)\\tan Offer where the Securities are Convertibles issued under a Prospectus to existing members or creditors of the Issuer or a member of its Group and there is no additional consideration to be paid;\\n(8)\\tan Offer where the Securities are offered in connection with a Takeover and a document is made available containing information which is considered by the Regulator as being equivalent to that of a Prospectus;\\n(9)\\tan Offer where the Securities are offered, allotted or to be allotted in connection with a merger if a document is available containing information which is regarded by the Regulator as being equivalent to that of a Prospectus;\\n(10)\\tan Offer where the Securities are offered, allotted or to be allotted in connection with a rights issue where:\\n(a)\\tthe Securities are of a class subject to Reporting Entity disclosure; and\\n(b)\\ta document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the Securities including rights attaching to those Securities and the reasons for and details of the Offer;\\n(11)\\tan Offer where the Shares are offered, allotted or to be allotted to existing Shareholders free of charge or dividends paid out in the form of Shares of the same class as the Shares in respect of which the dividends are paid, and a document is made available containing information on the number and nature of the Shares and the reasons for and details of the Offer;\\n(12)\\tan Offer where the Securities are offered, allotted or to be allotted to an existing or former Director or Employee, or any Close Relative of such a Director or Employee, of the Issuer or a member of the same Group as the Issuer and\\n(a)\\tthe Issuer or the member of the Group already has its Securities admitted to trading on a Regulated Exchange; and\\n(b)\\ta document is made available to the offerees containing information on the number and nature of the Securities and the reasons for and details of the Offer; or\\n(13)\\tan Offer in or from the ADGM which is directed at no more than 200 Persons that are not Professional Clients or Market Counterparties, in circumstances where the Securities are, or have been, offered within a Private Financing Platform or via a Multilateral Trading Facility\\n4.3.2 \\tWhere any Securities, which were previously the subject of an Exempt Offer, are subsequently offered to the public, such a subsequent Offer will be regarded, for the purposes of Part 6 of the FSMR and the Rules made for the purposes of that Part, as a separate and new Offer of Securities to the Public, unless that Offer meets one of the criteria in Rule 4.3.1.\\n4.3.3\\t(1)\\tSubject to (2), an Offer of Securities remains an Exempt Offer even if the Offer falls in whole or part within more than one of the circumstances specified in Rule 4.3.1, as long as all of the Offer falls within at least one of those circumstances.\\n(2)\\tAn Issuer must not aggregate the limits contained in Rule 4.3.1(2) and Rule 4.3.1(13) when making an Exempt Offer.\\n4.3.4\\tA Person making an Exempt Offer must ensure that an exempt offer statement is included in the Exempt Offer Document. An exempt offer statement must contain the following statement displayed prominently on its front page:\\n…\\n4.3.5\\tPursuant to an Exempt Offer under Rule 4.3.1(13), the Issuer must provide a Product Summary Note to investors in accordance with the following requirements:\\n(1)\\tThe Product Summary Note must:\\n(a)\\thighlight key information in the Offer document to investors;\\n(b)\\tclearly disclose required information in the format as set out in APP 7;\\n(c)\\tgive a fair and balanced view of the nature, material benefits and material risks of the Securities offered;\\n(d)\\tnot contain any statement or information that is false or misleading in the form and context in which it is included;\\n(e)\\tbe given together with the Offer document to investors. If the Issuer makes the Offer document available online, the Product Summary Note must be made available online together with the Offer document;\\n(f)\\tnot contain any information that is not contained in the Offer document;\\n(g)\\tnot contain any Inside Information that differs in any material particular from that set out in the Offer document; and\\n(h)\\tnot omit any information from any part of the Product Summary Note which would result in that part of the Product Summary Note being construed as false or misleading.\\n(2)\\tThe Product Summary Note shall contain the prominent disclaimer set out in Rule 4.3.4 in bold, on its front.\\n(3)\\tThe Issuer must give notice the Regulator of its intention to provide a Product Summary Note at least ten Business Days prior to the Exempt Offer, in such form as the Regulator may prescribe.\\n(4)\\tWhen the Issuer makes any change to the Offer document, the Product Summary Note must be updated if the change has a material effect on the key information of the Securities offered.\\n(5)\\tIssuers must ensure there is clear naming of the Securities offered. The name of the Securities must be descriptive of the nature of the Securities offered. It must not give investors a misleading view of the true nature and risks of the Securities offered.'}]"

Here's what happens:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When sunlight enters our atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\\n\\n2. **Scattering occurs**: These gas molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light. As a result, when sunlight hits them, they scatter the light in all directions.\\n\\n3. **Shorter wavelengths scattered more**: However, shorter wavelengths like blue and violet are scattered more than longer wavelengths like red and orange. This is because the smaller molecules can only interact with the shorter wavelengths effectively due to their size relative to the wavelength of light.\\n\\n4. **Blue light dominates**: Due to this scattering effect, the shorter wavelengths (like blue) are distributed throughout the atmosphere in all directions, making it appear as though the sky is blue. The longer wavelengths like red and orange continue to travel in a straight line, which is why we see them more concentrated towards the horizon during sunrise and sunset.\\n\\nThis phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh who discovered this property of light scattering by gas molecules in 1871. He measured the amount of light scattered at different wavelengths, finding that shorter wavelengths were scattered more than longer ones.\\n\\nIn essence, the blue color we see in the sky is due to the way our atmosphere scatters sunlight, specifically how it interacts with smaller gas molecules and favors the shorter blue wavelengths over other colors.\",\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"context\":[128006,882,128007,271,10445,374,279,13180,6437,30,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,791,13180,8111,6437,1606,315,264,25885,2663,13558,64069,72916,11,7086,1306,279,8013,83323,10425,13558,64069,11,889,1176,7633,433,304,279,3389,220,777,339,9478,13,5810,596,1148,8741,1473,16,13,3146,31192,4238,29933,9420,596,16975,96618,3277,40120,29933,1057,16975,11,433,35006,13987,35715,315,45612,1778,439,47503,320,45,17,8,323,24463,320,46,17,3677,17,13,3146,3407,31436,13980,96618,4314,6962,35715,527,1790,9333,1109,279,46406,315,3177,13,1666,264,1121,11,994,40120,13280,1124,11,814,45577,279,3177,304,682,18445,382,18,13,3146,12755,261,93959,38067,810,96618,4452,11,24210,93959,1093,6437,323,80836,527,38067,810,1109,5129,93959,1093,2579,323,19087,13,1115,374,1606,279,9333,35715,649,1193,16681,449,279,24210,93959,13750,4245,311,872,1404,8844,311,279,46406,315,3177,382,19,13,3146,10544,3177,83978,96618,24586,311,420,72916,2515,11,279,24210,93959,320,4908,6437,8,527,4332,6957,279,16975,304,682,18445,11,3339,433,5101,439,3582,279,13180,374,6437,13,578,5129,93959,1093,2579,323,19087,3136,311,5944,304,264,7833,1584,11,902,374,3249,584,1518,1124,810,38626,7119,279,35174,2391,64919,323,44084,382,2028,25885,374,3967,439,13558,64069,72916,11,7086,1306,10425,13558,64069,889,11352,420,3424,315,3177,72916,555,6962,35715,304,220,9674,16,13,1283,17303,279,3392,315,3177,38067,520,2204,93959,11,9455,430,24210,93959,1051,38067,810,1109,5129,6305,382,644,28591,11,279,6437,1933,584,1518,304,279,13180,374,4245,311,279,1648,1057,16975,1156,10385,40120,11,11951,1268,433,84261,449,9333,6962,35715,323,54947,279,24210,6437,93959,927,1023,8146,13],\"total_duration\":73449141506,\"load_duration\":60800194970,\"prompt_eval_count\":16,\"prompt_eval_duration\":4157000000,\"eval_count\":325,\"eval_duration\":8490000000}"

This is because Relevant Persons are expected to comply with guidance issued by the Emirate of Dubai's Economic Office Committee for Non-Resident Affairs (EOCN), which suggests that clear guidelines exist for reporting suspicious activities.

This ensures that the chosen securities have a high credit quality and low default risk.\\n\\n**2. Similar Expected Payment Profile**: The portfolio of sovereign risk securities must have a similar expected payment profile to the liability being measured. To determine whether the payment profiles are similar, Captive Insurers should consider the following factors:\\n\\n* **Cash Flow Patterns**: The frequency and timing of cash inflows and outflows in the selected portfolio should be comparable to those of the liability being measured. For example, if the liability has a regular annual premium stream, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also have a similar regular payment schedule.\\n* **Cash Flow Volatility**: The volatility of cash flows in the selected portfolio should be comparable to that of the liability being measured. For instance, if the liability has significant upfront payments or unpredictable cash outflows, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also exhibit similar characteristics.\\n* **Payment Duration**: The duration of payments in the selected portfolio should align with the expected payment profile of the liability being measured. This means that if the liability has a long-term obligation, the chosen sovereign risk securities should have a similar long-term payment structure.\\n* **Repayment Terms**: The repayment terms of the selected portfolio should be comparable to those of the liability being measured. For example, if the liability has balloon payments or amortizing schedules, the chosen sovereign risk securities should also have similar repayment structures.\\n\\nTo ensure compliance with these requirements, Captive Insurers can consider the following best practices:\\n\\n* **Analysis of Credit Rating Agencies' Reports**: Review reports from Standard & Poor's (or equivalent) to verify that the selected sovereign risk securities meet the AAA-rating threshold.\\n* **Customized Stress Testing**: Conduct stress testing to assess how the selected portfolio would perform under various economic scenarios, including changes in interest rates, inflation, or credit spreads.\\n* **Review of Historical Data**: Examine historical payment data for both the liability being measured and the chosen sovereign risk securities to identify any similarities or differences in cash flow patterns.\\n\\nBy carefully evaluating these factors and considering best practices, Captive Insurers can select a suitable portfolio of sovereign risk securities that meets the requirements of Rule 6.10 or 6.11 and provides an accurate\"},\n",

This discerning approach is shown by the FSRA’s power to only permit VAs that it deems ‘acceptable’, as determined by risk factors such as security and traceability, in order to prevent the build-up of risk from illiquid or immature assets. Additionally, we do not permit stablecoins based on the algorithmic model of valuation to the underlying fiat currency.',\n",

The FSRA’s risk appetite for VA activities is such that it will only admit operators to its jurisdiction who at the outset can unequivocally meet the transparent, high standards outlined in its framework.

       "   'Principle 2 – High Standards for Authorisation. ADGM has become the destination of choice for many start-ups and investors in the VA sector as well as extant financial institutions looking to expand into this area. Since 2018 the FSRA has issued a number of Financial Services Permissions (FSPs) to trading venues (e.g. multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)) and market intermediaries, such as broker dealers, custodians and asset managers, and continues to provide the regulatory architecture for a vibrant, VA ecosystem.'],\n",
       "  'Answer': \"In the context of Principle 2 – High Standards for Authorisation, the ADGM evaluates and defines 'acceptable' Virtual Assets (VAs) through a discerning approach that prioritizes risk management and upholds high standards. The evaluation process involves assessing various risk factors to ensure that only VAs with robust security and traceability measures are permitted. This assessment is critical in preventing the accumulation of risk from illiquid or immature assets.\\n\\nThe key risk factors considered in this assessment include:\\n\\n1. **Security**: The ADGM evaluates the security protocols and controls implemented by the VA to prevent unauthorized access, hacking, or other forms of cyber threats.\\n2. **Traceability**: The FSRA assesses the ability of VAs to provide a clear audit trail, enabling the identification of transactions and participants in the event of any issues.\\n\\nIn addition to these risk factors, the ADGM also considers the VA's underlying model of valuation. Specifically, it does not permit stablecoins based on an algorithmic model of valuation tied to the underlying fiat currency. This approach ensures that VAs are not subject to potential volatility or manipulation risks associated with algorithmic valuation models.\\n\\nThe FSRA's risk appetite for VA activities is such that it will only admit operators to its jurisdiction who can demonstrate a high level of transparency and adherence to best-in-class standards. This includes:\\n\\n1. **Transparent business practices**: The ADGM requires VAs to maintain transparent business practices, including clear disclosure of fees, risks, and other material information.\\n2. **Compliance with regulatory requirements**: VA operators must demonstrate compliance with all applicable regulations and laws in the ADGM jurisdiction.\\n\\nThe goal of these high standards is to instill market confidence, promote growth and investment, and maintain the best-in-class reputation of the ADGM ecosystem. By admitting only operators who meet these rigorous standards, the ADGM provides a secure and stable environment for VA activities, making it an attractive destination for start-ups, investors, and established financial institutions looking to expand into the VA sector.\\n\\nIn summary, the ADGM's evaluation and definition of 'acceptable' VAs are guided by a discerning approach that prioritizes risk management, security, traceability, transparency, and compliance with regulatory requirements. By adopting this approach, the ADGM ensures a high level of confidence among market participants, fosters growth and investment in the VA sector, and maintains its position as a leading jurisdiction for Virtual Asset activities.\"},\n",

To provide guidance on documenting corporate governance practices related to such issues, we recommend the following best practices:\\n\\n1. **Clear Rationale**: When deciding not to submit ESG disclosures, it is essential to clearly articulate the reasons for this determination. This should be documented in a formal correspondence addressed to monitoring@adgm.com, as required by subsection 399B(5) of the CR.\\n2. **Explanation**: The company should provide a comprehensive explanation for its decision, highlighting any challenges or circumstances that led to this choice. This explanation should demonstrate an understanding of the \"comply or explain\" approach and the flexibility it offers.\\n3. **Governance Processes**: Companies are encouraged to document their governance processes related to ESG issues, even if they choose not to disclose certain information. This includes describing how they assess, manage, and monitor ESG risks and opportunities.\\n4. **Tailored Approach**: Recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance, companies should tailor their practices to suit their specific circumstances. This may involve adapting the principles outlined in the standards or adopting alternative approaches that achieve effective outcomes.\\n5. **Transparency**: While not disclosing all ESG-related information, companies are still expected to provide transparency regarding their decision-making process and any relevant factors considered. This can be achieved by documenting the rationale behind their choice and providing context for stakeholders.\\n6. **Board Considerations**: As emphasized in the General passage, companies with smaller boards or less complex businesses may choose not to establish multiple committees. In such cases, the board as a whole should undertake these functions, and this decision should be documented accordingly.\\n7. **Continuous Improvement**: Companies that choose not to disclose ESG-related information should remain committed to continuous improvement in their governance practices. This involves regularly reviewing and assessing their processes to ensure they are aligned with the company\\'s goals and values.\\n\\nBy following these best practices, companies can effectively document their corporate governance practices related to ESG issues, even if they choose not to disclose certain information. This ensures transparency, accountability, and a commitment to continuous improvement, all of which are essential for fostering an ecosystem that supports good practice in disclosing applicable information on ESG factors.\\n\\n**'},\n",
